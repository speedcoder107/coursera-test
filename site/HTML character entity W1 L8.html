    <h1>HTML character entity.</h1>
    <p>
        There are some characters in html, which we cannot use casually, because, they are part of the markup language.
        Like Pointed brackets and ampecent (short form of hand. So, to make these symbols, we use special codes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ampecent- &amp; </li>
        <li>less than- &lt;</li>
        <li>greater than- &gt;</li>
        <li>space- &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        space is used, when you have to use a lot of spaces (because html only uses one space and ingores of the other spaces) or space but without using space key. It is often used when nothing works, you
        want to wrap the whole text at the same time. Then,&nbsp;we&nbsp;use&nbsp;this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, The above words are going to stay togethor, even if we shorten the screen to wrap the text. These 4 words will get in the next line at the same time.
